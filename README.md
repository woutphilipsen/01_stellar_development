## You've got the Code for Symfony 4 Fundamentals: Services, Config & Environments. Yeehaw!

Hi there! Inside this code download you'll find the following things:

* A `start/` directory: how the project looked at the *start* of the tutorial

* A `finish/` directory: how the project looked after we did all the cool coding

In each directory, you'll find more details about how to set up the project.
But if you have any questions, just post a comment on the course page and
ask!ternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Start the built-in web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but the built-in web server works
great:

```
php bin/console server:run
```

Now check out the site at `http://localhost:8000`

Have fun!

## Somebody Has To

Somebody has to go polish the stars,
They're looking a little bit dull.
Somebody has to go polish the stars,
For the eagles and starlings and gulls
Have all been complaining they're tarnished and worn,
They say they want new ones we cannot afford.
So please get your rags
And your polishing jars,
Somebody has to go polish the stars.
